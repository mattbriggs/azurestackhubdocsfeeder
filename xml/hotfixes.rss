                - Fixed issue in internal secret rotation that would fail with a timeout error if value-add resource
                providers were unhealthy.<br>
                - Fixed a bug in which closed alerts' Last Modified Time was updated in the operator portal even if the
                alert stayed closed.<br>
                - Optimized operator alert request handling, which reduces the chance of timeouts when viewing alerts in
                the operator portal or monitoring them via SCOM.<br>
                - Check and enforce key protectors on cluster shared volumes per host.
                - Fixed issue in which Managed Disk usage data was not being reported after the 2008 update.
                - Fixed VMs losing connectivity while SuspendNode is occurring in MAS, as part of host reboot during
                patch and update.<br>
                - Added PEP to retrieve current registration details, stale object cleanup for Remove-Registration.
                - Fixed a bug which caused the Infrastructure Roles panel in the operator portal to display incorrect
                health information.<br>
                - Improved reliability of log collection for SDN roles by collecting logs on the file share.<br>
