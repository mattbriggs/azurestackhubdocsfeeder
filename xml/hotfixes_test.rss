            <title>Hotifx 1.2008.25.114</title>
            <description>Fixed issue in internal secret rotation that would fail with a timeout error if value-add
                resource providers were unhealthy. Fixed a bug in which closed alerts' Last Modified Time was updated in
                the operator portal even if the alert stayed closed. Optimized operator alert request handling, which
                reduces the chance of timeouts when viewing alerts in the operator portal or monitoring them via SCOM.
                Check and enforce key protectors on cluster shared volumes per host. Fixed issue in which Managed Disk
                usage data was not being reported after the 2008 update. Fixed VMs losing connectivity while SuspendNode
                is occurring in MAS, as part of host reboot during patch and update. Added PEP to retrieve current
                registration details, stale object cleanup for Remove-Registration. Fixed a bug which caused the
                Infrastructure Roles panel in the operator portal to display incorrect health information. Improved
                reliability of log collection for SDN roles by collecting logs on the file share.</description>
